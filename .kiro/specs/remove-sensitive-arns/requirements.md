# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a security vulnerability where sensitive AWS ARN data has been committed to the repository. The Code Defender security tool has identified specific KMS key ARNs that contain real AWS account information and need to be replaced with placeholder values to prevent exposure of sensitive infrastructure details.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want to remove sensitive ARN data from documentation files, so that real AWS account information is not exposed in the public repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the repository THEN the system SHALL NOT contain any real AWS account IDs in ARN examples
2. WHEN reviewing documentation files THEN all KMS key ARNs SHALL use placeholder account IDs like "123456789012" or generic examples
3. WHEN examining terraform.tfvars.example files THEN all ARN references SHALL use example/placeholder values
4. IF an ARN contains a real account ID THEN it SHALL be replaced with a placeholder account ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using this module, I want clear placeholder examples in documentation, so that I understand the expected ARN format without seeing real infrastructure details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading README.md files THEN KMS key ARN examples SHALL use consistent placeholder format
2. WHEN viewing terraform.tfvars.example files THEN ARN examples SHALL clearly indicate they are examples
3. WHEN following documentation THEN placeholder ARNs SHALL maintain valid AWS ARN structure
4. IF documentation shows ARN examples THEN they SHALL use generic account IDs and resource identifiers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to ensure no sensitive infrastructure details are exposed, so that we maintain security best practices and prevent information disclosure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing the codebase THEN no real AWS account IDs SHALL be present in documentation
2. WHEN Code Defender scans the repository THEN it SHALL NOT flag any sensitive ARN data
3. WHEN reviewing commit history THEN future commits SHALL NOT introduce real ARN data
4. IF sensitive data is detected THEN it SHALL be immediately replaced with placeholder values
