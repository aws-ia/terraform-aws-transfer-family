# AWS Transfer Family Terraform Module

This repository contains Terraform code which creates resources required to run a Transfer Family Server within AWS.

## Overview

This module creates and configures AWS Transfer Family resources with the following features:

- **Transfer Server**: SFTP server setup with protocol and security policies
- **Transfer Connectors**: Automated file transfer to/from external SFTP servers
- **Transfer Users**: User management with S3 bucket permissions and KMS access
- Custom hostname support through AWS Route53 or other DNS providers (Optional)
- CloudWatch logging configuration with a customizable retention

## Quick Start

```hcl
module "transfer_sftp" {
  source = "aws-ia/transfer-family/aws//modules/transfer-server"

  identity_provider = "SERVICE_MANAGED"
  protocols             = ["SFTP"]
  domain               = "S3"

  tags = {
    Environment = "Dev"
    Project     = "File Transfer"
  }
}
```

## Features

### Transfer Connectors

- Automated file transfer to/from external SFTP servers
- Support for scheduled file retrieval using EventBridge Scheduler
- Secure credential management via AWS Secrets Manager
- SSH host key validation and auto-discovery
- Static IP addresses for outbound connections
- Integration with S3 for file storage and KMS for encryption

### Transfer Server Configuration

- Deploy SFTP server endpoints with public endpoint type
- Server name customization (default: "transfer-server")
- S3 domain support
- SFTP protocol support
- Service-managed identity provider
- Support for custom hostnames and DNS configurations
- Integration with CloudWatch for logging and monitoring

### DNS Management

#### DNS Configuration

This module supports custom DNS configurations for your Transfer Family server using Route 53 or other DNS providers.

#### Route 53 Integration

```
dns_provider = "route53"
custom_hostname = "sftp.example.com"
route53_hosted_zone_name = "example.com."
```

For Other DNS Providers:

```
dns_provider = "other"
custom_hostname = "sftp.example.com"
```

#### The module checks

```
Route 53 configurations are complete when selected
Custom hostname is provided when a DNS provider is specified
```

### Logging Features

- Optional CloudWatch logging
- Configurable log retention period (default: 30 days)
- Automated IAM role and policy configuration for logging
- AWS managed logging policy attachment

## Security Policy Support

Supports multiple AWS Transfer security policies including:

- Standard policies (2018-11 through 2024-01)
- FIPS-compliant policies
- PQ-SSH Experimental policies
- Restricted security policies

## Validation Checks

The module includes several built-in checks to ensure proper configuration:

- Route53 configuration validation
- Custom hostname verification
- DNS provider configuration checks
- Domain name compatibility verification
- Security policy name validation
- Mandatory Elastic IP address allocation and association checks for Internet-facing VPC deployments

## Best Practices

- Enable CloudWatch logging for audit and monitoring purposes (optional, configurable via enable_logging variable)
- Use the latest security policies (default is TransferSecurityPolicy-2024-01, configurable with validation)
- Configure proper DNS settings when using custom hostnames (validated through check blocks)
- Utilize built-in validation checks for DNS provider and custom hostname configurations
- Use proper tagging for resources (supported via tags variable)

## Modules

This project utilizes multiple modules to create a complete AWS Transfer Family SFTP solution:

### Core Transfer Server Module (main module)

- Purpose: Creates and configures the AWS Transfer Server
- Key features:
  - SFTP protocol support
  - Hosting Server using Public or VPC configuration
  - CloudWatch logging setup
  - Service-managed authentication
  - Custom hostname support (optional)

### Transfer Users Module

- Purpose: Manages SFTP user access and permissions
- Key features:
  - CSV-based user configuration support
  - Optional test user creation
  - IAM role and policy management
  - Integration with S3 bucket permissions
  - KMS encryption key access management

### Transfer Connectors Module

- Purpose: Creates SFTP connectors for automated file transfers
- Key features:
  - External SFTP server connectivity
  - EventBridge Scheduler integration for automated retrieval
  - Secrets Manager integration for credential management
  - SSH host key auto-discovery and validation
  - Static IP address support for outbound connections

## Installation

To use these modules in your Terraform configuration:

1. Reference the modules in your Terraform code:

```hcl
module "transfer_server" {
  source = "aws-ia/transfer-family/aws//modules/transfer-server"

  # Module parameters
  # ...
}

module "transfer_connectors" {
  source = "aws-ia/transfer-family/aws//modules/transfer-connectors"

  # Required parameters
  url            = "sftp://external-server.com"

  # Optional parameters
  sftp_username  = "sftp-user"
  sftp_private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  trusted_host_keys = ["ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA..."]

  # ...
}
```

2. Initialize your Terraform workspace:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. Review the planned changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

4. Apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Basic Usage

### Simple SFTP Server Setup

```hcl
module "transfer_server" {
  source = "aws-ia/transfer-family/aws//modules/transfer-server"

  # Basic server configuration
  server_name       = "demo-transfer-server"
  domain           = "S3"
  protocols        = ["SFTP"]
  endpoint_type    = "PUBLIC"
  identity_provider = "SERVICE_MANAGED"

  # Enable logging
  enable_logging    = true
  log_retention_days = 14

  tags = {
    Environment = "Demo"
    Project     = "SFTP"
  }
}
```

### SFTP Connector with Automated File Retrieval

```hcl
module "sftp_connector" {
  source = "aws-ia/transfer-family/aws//modules/transfer-connectors"

  # Required parameters
  url           = "sftp://external-server.com"
  access_role = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/transfer-connector-role"

  # Authentication
  sftp_username    = "sftp-user"
  sftp_private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")

  # Security - SSH host keys for validation
  trusted_host_keys = [
    "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA..."
  ]

  # Optional features
  test_connector_post_deployment = true

  tags = {
    Environment = "Demo"
    Project     = "File Transfer"
  }
}
```

## Example for Internet Facing VPC Endpoint Configuration

This example demonstrates an internet-facing VPC endpoint configuration:

```hcl
module "transfer_server" {
  # Other configurations go here

  endpoint_type = "VPC"
  endpoint_details = {
    address_allocation_ids = aws_eip.sftp[*].allocation_id  # Makes the endpoint internet-facing
    security_group_ids     = [aws_security_group.sftp.id]
    subnet_ids             = local.public_subnets
    vpc_id                 = local.vpc_id
  }
}
```

Key points about VPC endpoint types:

- **Internet-facing endpoint**: Created when `address_allocation_ids` are specified (as shown in this example)
- Internet-facing endpoints require Elastic IPs and public subnets
- **Internal endpoint**: Created when `address_allocation_ids` are omitted
- Internal endpoints are only accessible from within the VPC or connected networks

## Key Connector Configuration

When using Transfer Connectors, pay attention to these critical attributes:

- **`url`**: SFTP server endpoint (required) - automatically adds `sftp://` prefix if not provided
- **`access_role`**: IAM role ARN for connector permissions (required, user-provided)
- **`trusted_host_keys`**: SSH host keys for server validation - leave empty for auto-discovery
- **`sftp_username`** and **`sftp_private_key`**: Authentication credentials
- **`user_secret_id`**: Alternative to providing credentials directly - use existing Secrets Manager secret
- **`security_policy_name`**: Must use connector-specific policies (default: `TransferSFTPConnectorSecurityPolicy-2024-03`)
- **`test_connector_post_deployment`**: Enable to validate connectivity after deployment - requires AWS CLI installation and checks for specific version compatibility. Will warn but not fail deployment if conditions aren't met.
