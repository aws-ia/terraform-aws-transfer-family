# Transfer Family Malware Protection Module

This module provides automated malware protection for AWS Transfer Family servers using Amazon GuardDuty. When malicious files are detected, they are automatically quarantined to a separate S3 bucket.

## Features

- **GuardDuty Malware Protection**: Automatically scans files uploaded to Transfer Family S3 buckets
- **Automatic Quarantine**: Lambda function moves infected files to quarantine bucket
- **Event-Driven**: Uses EventBridge to trigger quarantine actions on malware detection
- **Secure Configuration**: Includes encryption, X-Ray tracing, and dead letter queues
- **Organized Storage**: Quarantined files are organized by date with proper tagging

## Architecture

1. Files uploaded to Transfer Family S3 bucket are scanned by GuardDuty
2. When malware is detected, GuardDuty publishes a finding event
3. EventBridge rule matches the malware finding and triggers Lambda function
4. Lambda function copies the infected file to quarantine bucket and deletes from source
5. Quarantined files are tagged with metadata for tracking and compliance
