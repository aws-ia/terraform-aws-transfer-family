# AWS Transfer Family: SFTP Server with Public Endpoint with Service Managed Users

This example demonstrates an AWS Transfer Family SFTP server deployment with a public endpoint with service managed users, and S3 storage integration.

## Overview

This example configures:
- Public SFTP endpoint with service-managed users
- Secure S3 bucket with KMS encryption
- User management through CSV configuration
- CloudWatch logging with customizable retention

## Features


### Server Configuration
- Public SFTP endpoint deployment
- Service-managed authentication system
- Configurable logging retention
- Random resource name generation for uniqueness

### Storage Layer
- S3 bucket with:
  - KMS server-side encryption
  - Public access blocking
  - Versioning support
  - Secure bucket policies

### Security Implementation
- KMS encryption with automatic key rotation
- Service-managed authentication
- CloudWatch audit logging
- IAM role-based access control

## User Management

### CSV-Based User Configuration

Users are configured using a CSV file (`users.csv`) for bulk import (Optional)

#### users.csv Structure
```csv
username,home_dir,public_key,role_arn
user1,/user1,ssh-rsa AAAA...,arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/user1-role
```
    
#### Column Details

    username: Unique identifier for SFTP access
    home_dir: S3 bucket path (must start with /)
    public_key: SSH public key for authentication (ssh-rsa or ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521)
    role_arn: (Optional) Custom IAM role ARN

#### Implementation

    The user management is handled by the transfer-users module, which is called by the SFTP public endpoint example:

    Located in: modules/transfer-users
    Called by: examples/sftp-public-endpoint-service-managed-S3

Configuration in the example module:

    
module "sftp_users" {
  source = "../../modules/transfer-users"
  
  users           = local.users
  create_test_user = local.create_test_user
  server_id       = module.transfer_server.server_id
  s3_bucket_name  = module.s3_bucket.s3_bucket_id
  s3_bucket_arn   = module.s3_bucket.s3_bucket_arn
  sse_encryption_arn = aws_kms_key.sse_encryption.arn
}
    

#### Considerations

    CSV changes require terraform apply
    Validate SSH key formats and IAM role ARNs
    Ensure unique usernames and valid paths
    Keep CSV file updated and backed up


### DNS Configuration (Optional)

This example supports Route 53 integration for custom domain management. To enable:

1. Uncomment and configure DNS settings in locals:

locals {
  # dns_provider      = "route53"
  # base_domain       = "example.com"
  # custom_hostname   = "sftp.${local.base_domain}"
}


    Pass values to transfer server module:

    
module "transfer_server" {
  
  
  dns_provider             = local.dns_provider
  custom_hostname          = local.custom_hostname
  route53_hosted_zone_name = local.base_domain
}

## Security Considerations

- All S3 bucket public access is blocked
- KMS encryption is enabled for all stored objects
- CloudWatch logging captures all SFTP activities
- IAM roles follow least privilege principle
- SSH keys are securely managed
