# AWS Transfer Family: SFTP Server with Internet Facing VPC Endpoint with Service Managed Users

This example demonstrates an AWS Transfer Family SFTP server deployment with a VPC endpoint with service managed users, and S3 storage integration.

## Overview

This example configures:

- VPC SFTP endpoint with service-managed users
  - Internet-facing endpoint using Elastic IP addresses
  - (Note: Omitting `address_allocation_ids` would create an internal VPC endpoint)
- Secure S3 bucket with KMS encryption
- User import through CSV configuration
- CloudWatch logging with customizable retention
- Configurable security groups with CIDR-based access control
- Enhanced security with latest security policy (TransferSecurityPolicy-2025-03)
- Optional workflow integration for file processing

## Features

### Server Configuration

- VPC SFTP endpoint deployment
  - Internet-facing endpoint when `address_allocation_ids` are specified
  - Internal endpoint when `address_allocation_ids` are not specified
- Service-managed authentication system
- Configurable logging retention
- Random resource name generation for uniqueness

### Storage Layer

- S3 bucket with:
  - KMS server-side encryption
  - Public access blocking
  - Versioning support
  - Secure bucket policies

### Security Implementation

- Service-managed authentication
- CloudWatch logging
- IAM role-based access control
- Configurable CIDR-based access control for ingress and egress traffic
- Enhanced security with TransferSecurityPolicy-2025-03
- KMS key rotation enabled for encryption keys

## User Management

### CSV-Based User Import

Users are imported into the service using a CSV file (`users.csv`) for bulk import (Optional)

#### users.csv Structure

```csv
username,home_dir,public_key,role_arn
user1,/user1,ssh-rsa AAAA...,arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/user1-role
```

#### Column Details

```
username: Unique identifier for SFTP access
home_dir: S3 bucket path (must start with /)
public_key: SSH public key for authentication (ssh-rsa or ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521)
role_arn: (Optional) Custom IAM role ARN
```

#### Implementation

The user import is handled by the transfer-users module:

```
Located in: modules/transfer-users
Called by: examples/sftp-internet-facing-vpc-endpoint-service-managed-S3
```

Configuration in the example module:

```
module "sftp_users" {
    source = "../../modules/transfer-users"
    users = local.users
    create_test_user = true # Test user is for demo purposes
    server_id = module.transfer_server.server_id
    s3_bucket_name = module.s3_bucket.s3_bucket_id
    s3_bucket_arn = module.s3_bucket.s3_bucket_arn
    kms_key_id = aws_kms_key.transfer_family_key.arn
}
```

#### Considerations

```
CSV changes require terraform apply
Validate SSH key formats and IAM role ARNs
Ensure unique usernames and valid paths
Keep CSV file updated and backed up
```

### DNS Configuration (Optional)

1. This example supports Route 53 integration for custom domain management. To enable:

Set the variables `dns_provider='route53'`, `custom_hostname=<YOUR_CUSTOM_HOSTNAME>`, `route53_hosted_zone_name=<YOUR_ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE>`

```hcl
module "transfer_server" {

  # Other configurations go here

  dns_provider             = var.dns_provider
  custom_hostname          = var.custom_hostname
  route53_hosted_zone_name = var.route53_hosted_zone_name
}
```

2. This example also supports integration for custom domain management with other DNS providers. To enable:

Set the variables `dns_provider='other'`, `custom_hostname=<YOUR_CUSTOM_HOSTNAME>`

```hcl
module "transfer_server" {

  # Other configurations go here

  dns_provider             = var.dns_provider
  custom_hostname          = var.custom_hostname
}
```

## Security Considerations

- All S3 bucket public access is blocked
- KMS encryption is enabled for Amazon S3
- CloudWatch logging is enabled
- IAM roles are created. For production - review and apply permissions as required
- Configurable CIDR blocks for SFTP ingress and egress traffic
- Latest security policy (TransferSecurityPolicy-2025-03) applied

## VPC Endpoint Configuration

This example demonstrates an internet-facing VPC endpoint configuration:

```hcl
module "transfer_server" {
  # Other configurations go here
  
  endpoint_type = "VPC"
  endpoint_details = {
    address_allocation_ids = aws_eip.sftp[*].allocation_id  # Makes the endpoint internet-facing
    security_group_ids     = [aws_security_group.sftp.id]
    subnet_ids             = local.public_subnets
    vpc_id                 = local.vpc_id
  }
}
```

Key points about VPC endpoint types:
- **Internet-facing endpoint**: Created when `address_allocation_ids` are specified (as shown in this example)
- **Internal endpoint**: Created when `address_allocation_ids` are omitted
- Internet-facing endpoints require Elastic IPs and public subnets
- Internal endpoints are only accessible from within the VPC or connected networks
