# SFTP Server with Multiple SSH Keys Example

This example demonstrates how to create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP server with users that have multiple SSH public keys. This configuration showcases:

- **Single Key User**: Traditional single SSH key configuration for backward compatibility.
- **Multiple Key User**: User with multiple SSH keys for key rotation and redundancy.
- **Key Rotation User**: User with both current and new keys for seamless rotation.

## Key Features

- Support for both single and multiple SSH keys per user
- Demonstrates key rotation scenarios
- Shows mixed user configurations in the same deployment
- Uses service-managed identity provider
- Includes S3 bucket with KMS encryption
- CloudWatch logging enabled

## Usage

Replace the example SSH keys in the `users` local variable with your actual public keys before deploying.

**Note**: The SSH keys in this example are truncated for readability. You must provide complete, valid SSH public keys.
